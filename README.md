# Slack-Bot-Age-Calculator üñ©

Slack-Bot is a communication tool used by developers and companies to share information and communicate. It has grown very popular in recent years.

In this Golang project , we‚Äôre building a slack bot that calculates age. To calculate a person‚Äôs age in years we just have to take the difference between the current year and their birth years.

## Usage üî•

1. In your Slack workspace, invite the bot to a channel by mentioning the bot using the designated bot username.

2. In the channel, you can use the following command to calculate the age of a person:

 ``` /agecalc [date of birth] ```
